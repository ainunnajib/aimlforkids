# ML for NOAI

An educational website to teach secondary school students about machine learning techniques required for Singapore's National Olympiad in AI (NOAI).

## Overview

This website covers all the machine learning topics aligned with the IOAI (International Olympiad in AI) syllabus, which NOAI follows. It's designed to be accessible to secondary school students while providing comprehensive coverage of essential ML concepts.

## Topics Covered

1. **ML Fundamentals** - Data preprocessing, evaluation metrics, cross-validation, overfitting/underfitting
2. **Supervised Learning** - Linear regression, logistic regression, KNN, decision trees, SVM, ensemble methods
3. **Unsupervised Learning** - K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, PCA, t-SNE, UMAP
4. **Neural Networks** - Perceptrons, activation functions, MLPs, backpropagation, optimizers, regularization
5. **Computer Vision** - CNNs, ResNet, image classification, object detection, transfer learning, data augmentation
6. **Natural Language Processing** - Tokenization, word embeddings, RNNs, attention, transformers, BERT

## Features

- Modern, responsive design
- Interactive quizzes for self-assessment
- Code examples in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch)
- Clear explanations with formulas and visualizations
- Navigation between related topics
